##Terminal Chess

To play please download this repo and run 'ruby chess.rb' in your terminal

Chess is 2-player, logic driven game built in Ruby with:
* User input error catching
* Class inheritance from a generic piece class into more specific sliding/stepping/pawn piece classes
* Error checking for legal move based on chosen piece
* Error checking to ensure player does not put oneself into 'check'
